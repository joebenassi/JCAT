(old: similar, but not accurate)

TOOLS TO NAVIGATE JCAT CODE:
	1. SUMMARY OF STARTUP: Walkthrough of code execution. [Broad Overview].
	2. PACKAGE INFORMATION: Breif summary of each class. [Description of Parts].
	3. JavaDocs: In-Depth. [Highly-Detailed Definitions].

---------------------------------
SUMMARY OF STARTUP: 
main.Launcher.main is executed. 
	A Shell is created. 
	gui.mainpage.MainPageFiller is utilized.
		Adds a TopBar, StatusWindowSash, and CommandLine to the Shell.
	gui.menu is utilized.
		Adds a menu without apps to the Shell (the Command and Telemetry menus are empty).
		When File -> Populate Apps -> (Select XML files) -> Open is clicked,
		applications.XMLParser is utilized.
			XMLParser parses each document for app configuration details, and 
			creates a new applications.App.
				Each App is completely defined, including all Telemetry and 
				Command information. Creates its gui.popup.PopupFiller, which will
				display telemetry information. There is no equivalent like this for Command.
					PopupFiller is completely defined. Creates its various 
					parts: Titlebox, UniversalBox, LeftBar, and EntryBox and its Entrys.
					When File -> Telemetry -> (SomeApp) is clicked, (SomeApp).launchPopup()
					is executed, which displays its instance of PopupFiller, and its 
					telemetry information.

	and value of a single telemetry entry. There is an array 
	of them for each App, and the GUI is updated by setting

	said App.
	B. LeftBar: (Contained within a PopupFiller)
	C. TitleBox: (Contained within a PopupFiller)
	D. UniversalBox: (Contained within a PopupFiller)
	E. EntryBox: (Contained within a PopupFiller)
	F. Entry: (Contained within an EntryBox)
	G. ProgressBarPopup: (CLASS SUBJECT TO CHANGE/REMOVAL) (CURRENTLY UNUSED).
	

	
gui.menu.prompts:
